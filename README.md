# hello-world
Just getting the hang of things with Github

My name is Rami Abou-Shamalah. I am hoping to learn code as a means to optimize my skills as a data analytician, but also perhaps to be more independent and learn for the love of learning. Independent as in to learn to code my own website as opposed to hiring somebody or using a readily-made platform like Wordpress!
